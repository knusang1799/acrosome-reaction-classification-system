# acrosome-reaction-classification-system
Acrosome reaction classification system (ARCS) is detecting algorithm for analysis of acrosome reaction (AR) of the mammalian sperm in the microscopic images. The ARCS repository contains trained models for detection of the AR and test images. 

The codes are modified in object_detection_tutorial.ipynb of the TensorFlow Object Detection API.
You can see the original version of the codes in the TensorFlow Object Detection API.

The files is edited for detection of the acrosome reaction of sperm by Dr. Sang-Hee Lee.
If you have question regarding codes and information, please send the email.
